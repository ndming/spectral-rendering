# Multi-spectral Rendering with `pbrt`

## Scenes
- Patch of material for the pil: 
    - Only 1 camera pov
    - Global illumination: 1 standard illuminant
- Patch of material for the metal thin without texture: 
    - Only 1 camera pov (like the patch we already have), 
    - Global illumination: 1 standard illuminant (same SPD with pil)
- Patch of material for the plastic
    - Only 1 camera pov
    - Global illumination: 1 standard illuminant (same SPD with pil)
- Patch of the material for the metal thin with the texture: various camera pov (front like other patches, 0:45 with illuminant,1 other (up to you or just make 2 pov first), illumination (global, from side (like in pdf), from diagonal, all camera from the front of object), try with a couple of spd
- 1 Pil on white tiles (give white tiles with reflectance 1 in all wavelength/use spectralon reflectance that we have): various camera pov (front like other patches, 0:45 with illuminant,1 other (up to you or just make 2 pov first), illumination (global, from side (like in pdf), from diagonal, all camera from the front of object), try with a couple of spd
- Plastic cover on white tiles (give white tiles with reflectance 1 in all wavelength/use spectralon reflectance that we have): various camera pov (front like other patches, 0:45 with illuminant,1 other (up to you or just make 2 pov first), illumination (global, from side (like in pdf), from diagonal, all camera from the front of object), try with a couple of spd
- 1 pil on top of metal thin with texture on top of white tiles (give white tiles with reflectance 1 in all wavelength/use spectralon reflectance that we have): various camera pov (front like other patches, 0:45 with illuminant,1 other (up to you or just make 2 pov first), illumination (global, from side (like in pdf), from diagonal, all camera from the front of object), try with a couple of spd
- 1 pil with 1 plastic cover on top of white tiles (give white tiles with reflectance 1 in all wavelength/use spectralon reflectance that we have): various camera pov (front like other patches, 0:45 with illuminant,1 other (up to you or just make 2 pov first), illumination (global, from side (like in pdf), from diagonal, all camera from the front of object), try with a couple of spd
- 1 pil with 1 plastic cover on top of metal thin with texture on top of white tiles (give white tiles with reflectance 1 in all wavelength/use spectralon reflectance that we have): various camera pov (front like other patches, 0:45 with illuminant,1 other (up to you or just make 2 pov first), illumination (global, from side (like in pdf), from diagonal, all camera from the front of object), try with a couple of spd
- the complex scene on top of white tiles (give white tiles with reflectance 1 in all wavelength/use spectralon reflectance that we have): various camera pov (front like other patches, 0:45 with illuminant,1 other (up to you or just make 2 pov first), illumination (global, from side (like in pdf), from diagonal, all camera from the front of object), try with a couple of spd
